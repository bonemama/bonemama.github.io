I have always been moderately good with technology- it never took me long to understand how to work new devices or websites worked. In high school I was really good in English. I studied Kinesiology (the study of human movement) as an undergraduate student, and I have dreams of going to medical school once I have my requisite courses completed. None of this seems to be an outstanding reason to pursuing software development. 

However, I have always been fascinated about how things worked. I am not good enough with math to have studied engineering, and my major left me with no time for fun classes or a minor. I had been tinkering with some free online coding resources to build a foundation until I had the time to learn more seriously. As a society, we rely greatly on our handheld computers, even moreso in hospitals, clinics and the like. Technology will continue to evolve and integrate into health sciences. I feel that it is imperative that I understand how these computer programs work. I want to be able to help (potential future) patients and colleagues and ensure programs are running properly and assist where I can.
